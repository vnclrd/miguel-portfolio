          TrainIn is an automated attendance system designed to record and track
          the attendance of individuals at organized events. It uses NFC cards
          along with an external reader device to provide a seamless and
          efficient check-in and check-out process. The collected data can then
          be compiled into summaries and reports for easy analysis and management.
